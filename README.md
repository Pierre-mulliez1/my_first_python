# my_first_python
A small python exercise done on datacamp:
This project is based on the exercise and lesson: intermediate Python for data science offered by Datacamp.
Here is the text on which my code is based upon :
"You are walking up the empire state building and playing a game with a friend.
For 100 times you throw a dice,
if the throw gives 1 or 2 you go one step down,
if the throw gives 3, 4 or 5 you go one step up,
If you  throw a 6 you re-throw the dice and move up the number indicated by the dice.
You cannot go below 0
and you admit you have a 0.1% chance of falling down the stairs when making a move,
falling down means you have to start again from step 0.
You are betting you will reach 60 step high
What is the probability you will win this bet?"
